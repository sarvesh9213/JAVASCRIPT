# 📘 JavaScript Revision & Learning

Welcome to my **JavaScript Revision Repository**! 🚀  
This repository is dedicated to revising and strengthening my JavaScript fundamentals.

A few months ago, I had learned around 50% of JavaScript but left many important topics (like `async/await`) because I was feeling a bit bored. Now, while diving into **ReactJS**, I realized how crucial it is to have a **strong grip on JavaScript basics**. So, I’ve decided to start fresh and complete my learning journey properly.

## 🎯 Goals of this Repository

- Revise core JavaScript concepts from the ground up.
- Cover the topics I skipped earlier (like asynchronous programming).
- Practice and build confidence for ReactJS and other advanced frameworks.
- Keep all code, notes, and examples well-documented for future reference.
